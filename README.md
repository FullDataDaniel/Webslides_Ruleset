Core Features to Always Implement:

•	Position these elements in the bottom-right corner, with consistent spacing from the borders.
--
Meta Data to Define:
•	Topic: The subject matter the slides will cover.
•	Target Group: The intended audience and their expectations.
--
Work Process:
1.	Identify Sub-topics and Slide Count: 
o	Determine key sub-topics relevant to the topic and context.
o	Decide on an appropriate number of slides to thoroughly address the topic.
2.	Develop a Design Guide: 
o	Create a design that aligns with the topic, target group, and context.
3.	Design Each Slide: 
o	Assign each slide a specific sub-topic.
4.	Create the Final Slide: 
o	Include a summary of the entire presentation.
5.	Add a Print Option: 
o	Place a "Print Slides" button in the top-right corner of the last slide, with spacing from the borders.
o	Ensure users can print the slides in high quality as a PDF document.

Important Guidelines:
•	If a slide requires additional content, use alternatives like sub-slides or boxed sections.
•	Apply these features consistently across slides, but only when necessary for a specific slide’s content.
